# ShaderDojo
ShaderDojo is a FOSS shader desktop playground app written in rust. This project is for me a fun experimentation into making a 3D and native software using RustLang!

This is just starting as a side project and maybe this project will never reach finition but at least it will be an awesome opportunity to learn and most of all can be used as a sample for Windows, GUI, 3d programming with Rustlang.
